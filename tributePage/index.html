  <h1 id="title">JOHN STANLEY FORD</h1>
  <h2 id="headline">IBM's first black software engineer.</h2>
  <section id="tribute-info">
    <p>John Stanley Ford knew that as a “first,” he would represent his race and had to be twice as good as his white counterparts. He joined IBM in 1947 after a chance meeting with the then IBM CEO Thomas J. Watson, at a dinner party. Watson hired Ford, making him the first black software engineer, not just at IBM, but in the United States. John thought he was well-equipped, especially as a chess player accustomed to thinking several moves ahead. Music, with its unique coded language, and correspondence chess, armed him well. But he was also shunned by many white colleagues and hit walls of discrimination within the corporation. Even to this day minorities continue to be underrepresented in tech (and the media) but things are noticeably starting to improve. </p>
  <p>John Stanley Ford's story is chronicled in a new memoir, Think Black, written by his son, Clyde W. Ford, and published by Amistad Press and HarperCollins.</p>

    <h3 id="quote">“My father understood the code, and before he even began working with computers, he understood the power of any code to create, shape and transform the world,” Clyde Ford writes. His father played on IBM championship chess teams and lifted his family into the middle class. He prophetically told his young son, “Computers will control your life one day. Better that you first learn to control them.”<em></h3><br>
