# freecodecamp-certification-project-tribute-page

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

For this project I wanted to recap on responsive design, and built a tribute page that rescales itself to preserve the user experience and look and feel across all devices. I chose to dedicate my tribute page to the one and only John Stanley Ford who not only became the first black software engineer at IBM, but one of the very first in the USA. 

Working on the tribute page helped solidify my understanding of how to apply responsive design when building websites and understand how to apply it more confidently into my CSS.
